# Active Context - Prompt Manager VS Code Extension

## Current Status: VAN MODE - Architecture Analysis Complete

### Major Project Evolution Identified

The project has undergone **significant architectural transformation** since the last Memory Bank usage, evolving from a basic extension to a sophisticated, enterprise-level VSCode extension.

## Recently Completed (Per Archive Analysis)

- ✅ Copy Button Enhancement completed on 2025-06-15
- ✅ Archive: docs/archive/archive-copy-button-enhancement-20250615.md

## Current Architecture State

### Core Systems Implemented

- ✅ **Dependency Injection Container**: Full IoC with service resolution
- ✅ **Feature-Based Architecture**: Modular prompt-manager + search features
- ✅ **Event Bus System**: Sophisticated pub/sub communication
- ✅ **Advanced Search**: Webview integration with real-time filtering
- ✅ **Configuration Service**: Runtime config updates and validation
- ✅ **Tree View System**: Complete CRUD with context menus
- ✅ **File Management**: Comprehensive file/folder operations
- ✅ **Testing Framework**: Full test coverage with integration tests

### Technical Implementation

- **Entry Point**: `src/extension/extension.ts` with DI initialization
- **Commands**: Centralized handling via `CommandHandler`
- **UI Components**: Tree provider + Search webview panel
- **Business Logic**: Controllers and repositories with clean separation
- **Infrastructure**: Config, DI, FS, and VSCode service abstractions

## Memory Bank Status After VAN Analysis

### Files Requiring Updates

- ❌ **techContext.md**: Missing entirely - needs creation
- ❌ **systemPatterns.md**: Missing entirely - needs creation
- ✅ **projectbrief.md**: Updated to reflect current architecture
- ✅ **activeContext.md**: Updated with current analysis

### Architecture Complexity

**Level 4 - Complex System**:

- Multi-layer architecture with clear boundaries
- Dependency injection with service lifetime management
- Event-driven communication patterns
- Advanced search and UI capabilities
- Comprehensive testing strategy

## Current Focus: Memory Bank Synchronization

**Immediate Priority**: Complete Memory Bank updates to reflect current sophisticated architecture state before proceeding with any new development tasks.

**Next Steps**:

1. Create comprehensive `techContext.md` documenting DI system and architecture
2. Create `systemPatterns.md` documenting architectural patterns and conventions
3. Ready system for new task initialization with accurate project state
