# Active Context - Prompt Manager VS Code Extension

## Current Status: READY FOR NEW TASK ASSIGNMENT üöÄ

### Recently Completed Task

**Fix Nested Folders Display Bug** - Level 2 Simple Enhancement completed on 2025-01-19

- Fixed critical bug where nested folders were not displaying in extension tree view
- Root cause: Folder flattening logic only taking first directory level
- Simple solution: Removed flattening logic, leveraged VSCode Tree API naturally
- **Key Learning**: Simple solutions using platform APIs are better than complex workarounds
- **Archive**: [docs/archive/archive-nested-folders-fix-20250119.md](../docs/archive/archive-nested-folders-fix-20250119.md)
- **Reflection**: [memory-bank/reflection/reflection-nested-folders-fix.md](reflection/reflection-nested-folders-fix.md)

## Previously Completed

- ‚úÖ Drag and Drop Prompts Between Folders - Level 3 Intermediate Feature completed on 2025-01-18
- ‚úÖ Remove Redundant "Open Prompt" Button - Level 2 Enhancement completed on 2025-06-18
- ‚úÖ Copy Button Enhancement completed on 2025-06-15

## Current Architecture State

### Core Systems Implemented

- ‚úÖ **Dependency Injection Container**: Full IoC with service resolution
- ‚úÖ **Feature-Based Architecture**: Modular prompt-manager + search features
- ‚úÖ **Event Bus System**: Sophisticated pub/sub communication
