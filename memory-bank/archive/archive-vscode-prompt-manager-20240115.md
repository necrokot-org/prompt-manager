# ARCHIVE: VSCode Prompt Manager Extension

**Feature ID**: vscode-prompt-manager  
**Date Archived**: 2024-01-15  
**Status**: COMPLETED & ARCHIVED  
**Complexity Level**: Level 3 (Intermediate Feature)

## 1. Feature Overview

The VSCode Prompt Manager Extension is a comprehensive tool for managing LLM prompts within VSCode. It provides a native tree view interface for organizing, creating, editing, and managing prompt files with metadata support. The extension integrates seamlessly with VSCode's Explorer panel and follows VSCode design patterns for optimal user experience.

**Core Purpose**: Enable developers to efficiently organize and access their LLM prompts directly within their development environment, reducing context switching and improving productivity.

**Original Task Reference**: See `memory-bank/tasks.md` - "VSCode Prompt Manager Extension"

## 2. Key Requirements Met

### UI/UX Design

- **Tree View Structure**: Folders-first alphabetical sorting with modification date for files
- **Icon System**: Folder and file icons with contextual tooltips for enhanced usability
- **Add Prompt Workflow**: Dialog-based creation with folder selection and validation

### Data Management Design
