# VSCode Prompt Manager Extension - Fix Nested Folders Display Bug (SIMPLIFIED)

## Task Status: âœ… COMPLETED AND ARCHIVED

## ðŸŽ¯ TASK OVERVIEW

**Task**: Fix nested folders not being displayed in the extension tree view
**Complexity Level**: Level 2 - Simple Enhancement (Bug Fix)
**Priority**: High
**Estimated Effort**: Small (Simplified approach)
**Completion Date**: 2025-01-19

### Problem Description

Nested folders are not showing up in the VSCode extension pane. The `PromptOrganizer` class is flattening the folder hierarchy by only taking the top-level directory name, causing nested folders to be grouped under their parent instead of maintaining proper nesting.

**Root Cause**: In `src/scanner/PromptOrganizer.ts` line 23:

```typescript
const topLevelDir = dirName.split(path.sep)[0]; // Only takes first level!
```

### Requirements

- Display nested folders in their proper hierarchical structure
- Maintain existing functionality for root-level folders and prompts
- Keep code simple and readable - **NO NEED** to distinguish top-level vs nested folders
- Handle empty nested directories correctly
