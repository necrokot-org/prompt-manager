### 🐛 LEVEL 1 BUG FIX IMPLEMENTED

**Issue**: Extension was using the Explorer pane instead of creating its own view container

**Fix Applied**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

- **Changed**: Modified `package.json` view configuration
- **Added**: Custom `viewsContainers` with activity bar integration
- **Result**: Extension now creates its own dedicated pane with "Prompt Manager" icon
- **Files Modified**: `package.json`
- **Testing**: ✅ Build successful with no errors

#### Configuration Changes Made:

```json
// Before: View in Explorer pane
"views": {
  "explorer": [...]
}

// After: Dedicated view container
"viewsContainers": {
  "activitybar": [
    {
      "id": "promptManager",
      "title": "Prompt Manager",
      "icon": "$(edit)"
    }
  ]
},
"views": {
  "promptManager": [...]
}
```

**Status**: ✅ **BUG FIX COMPLETE** - Extension now has its own dedicated view pane
