## Build Verification Checklist

✅ **Directory structure created correctly**: All source files in `/home/kot/Work/prompt-manager/src/`  
✅ **All files created in correct locations**: TypeScript compilation successful  
✅ **All file paths verified with absolute paths**: Build output in `/home/kot/Work/prompt-manager/dist/`  
✅ **All planned changes implemented**: Following layered architecture design  
✅ **Testing performed for all changes**: Extension builds and activates without errors  
✅ **Code follows project standards**: ESLint validation passed  
✅ **Edge cases handled appropriately**: Error handling implemented throughout  
✅ **Build documented with absolute paths**: All file locations documented  
✅ **tasks.md updated with progress**: All requirements and components completed  
✅ **progress.md updated with details**: Comprehensive build documentation complete

## Architecture Implementation Summary

The extension successfully implements the layered architecture design:

**Infrastructure Layer**: VSCode API and Node.js file system integration  
**Data Access Layer**: FileManager handles all file I/O operations safely within workspace scope  
**Business Logic Layer**: PromptManager coordinates functionality and maintains state  
**Presentation Layer**: PromptTreeProvider implements native VSCode TreeView interface  
**Command Layer**: CommandHandler routes user actions with proper error handling

## Performance Optimizations Implemented

- **File System Caching**: Scan results cached in memory with change detection
- **File Watching**: Automatic refresh on file system changes (debounced 500ms)
- **Lazy Loading**: Tree items loaded on-demand for large prompt collections
- **Efficient Sorting**: Folders alphabetical, files by modification date
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of watchers and event listeners

## Next Recommended Steps

✅ **BUILD MODE COMPLETE**

**→ RECOMMENDED: REFLECT MODE**  
**Reason**: All implementation phases completed successfully, comprehensive reflection needed to capture lessons learned and assess design decision effectiveness.

## Extension Usage Instructions

The VSCode Prompt Manager extension is now ready for use:

1. **Installation**: Extension can be loaded in VSCode's extension development host
2. **Activation**: Automatically activates when workspace is opened
3. **Tree View**: Shows in Explorer panel as "Prompt Manager"
4. **Adding Prompts**: Click + button or use Command Palette
5. **Organization**: Create folders and organize prompts hierarchically
6. **Editing**: Double-click prompts to open in editor
7. **Management**: Right-click for context menu options

The extension follows VSCode design patterns for native user experience and includes comprehensive error handling for robust operation.
