# Enhancement Archive: Add Inline Copy Prompt Content Button

## Summary
Successfully implemented an inline copy button feature for the VSCode Prompt Manager extension that allows users to copy prompt content directly from the tree view interface with automatic YAML front matter exclusion.

## Date Completed
2025-06-15

## Key Files Modified
- package.json - Added copyPromptContent command and inline menu configuration
- src/commandHandler.ts - Implemented copyPromptContent command handler with error handling
- src/promptManager.ts - Added clipboard functionality and front matter parsing logic

## Requirements Addressed
- Inline copy button appears directly on each prompt file line in tree view
- One-click operation copies content to clipboard excluding YAML front matter
- Immediate user feedback through status bar success/error messages
- Seamless integration with existing VSCode TreeView inline actions

## Implementation Details
Three main components implemented: 1) Command registration in package.json with inline group, 2) Command handler in CommandHandler class with error handling, 3) Content processing in PromptManager with YAML front matter parsing using regex pattern matching.

## Testing Performed
- Manual testing with prompts containing valid YAML front matter
- Testing with prompts without front matter (fallback behavior)
- UI integration testing with existing inline actions
- Clipboard functionality verification

## Lessons Learned
- Robust content parsing is crucial for user-generated files
- Immediate user feedback improves extension user experience
- Breaking implementation into discrete phases improves development efficiency
